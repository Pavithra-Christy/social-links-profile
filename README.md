## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

During this project, I learned how to:

- Use CSS custom properties effectively for theming.
- Apply responsive design techniques with a mobile-first approach.
- Implement hover and focus states to improve accessibility and user experience.

Hereâ€™s a snippet of the CSS hover effect I implemented:

```css
button:hover {
    background-color: var(--Green);
    color: var(--Grey900);
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Improve on implementing more complex responsive design patterns.
- Explore additional CSS animation techniques to enhance interactivity.
- Experiment with accessibility features like ARIA roles to make web pages more inclusive.

### Useful Resources

- [CSS Tricks - Custom Properties](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-custom-properties/) - A comprehensive guide to using CSS variables effectively.
- [MDN Web Docs - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) - A great resource for understanding ARIA roles and attributes.
